# Atlantic-Hurricanes
The project is to find the best possible fit distribution for two different categories of Hurricanes.
There are two categories- Hurricane 4 and Hurricane 5.
The ipython notebook contains the explanation about the data and its features.
There are different types of plots made which helps to find coorelation between the features and two categories.
With this help, we determine the best fit distribution of the data.
